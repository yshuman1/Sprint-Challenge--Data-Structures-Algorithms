Add your answers to the questions below.

> these are not my answers. I am still confused about calculating processor cost

1.  What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method? 0(n)

2.  What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function? 0(n)

3.  What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? 0(n)

4.  What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? the width of the tree?

5.  What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function? 0(n\*lg(n))

6.  What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function?

Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

0(n)
